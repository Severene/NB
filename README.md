Nanoverse battery is a nanosized universe in a box, the size of a dice. (Hat tip to Rick and Morty.) The user interfaces with creatures on a nano scale, helping them to create energy. Encouraging their development until they produce power on their own, eventually allowing you to siphon off this energy to power your console. (This is just a mini-game to power a way into the main game.)
